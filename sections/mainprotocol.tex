\subsection{Information-Theoretic Abstraction}
\label{sec:abstraction}


Before we present our concrete polynomial commitment scheme based on groups of unknown order, we present the underlying information theoretic protocol that abstracts the concrete cryptographic instantiations. 
The purpose of this abstraction is two-fold: first, it provides an intuitive stepping stone from which presenting and studying the concrete cryptographic protocol is easier; and second, it opens the door to alternative cryptographic instantiations that provide the same interface but based on alternative hardness assumptions. %Like the underlying information theoretic protocol in FRI~\cite{ICALP:BBHR18}, this protocol operates by recursively dividing the working polynomial into two parts and then combining the two parts with a random weight.

Let $[\![ * ]\!] : \mathbb{Z}_p[X] \rightarrow \mathbb{S}$ be a homomorphic commitment function that sends polynomials over a prime field to elements of some set $\mathbb{S}$. Moreover, let $\mathbb{S}$ be equipped with operations $* + * : \mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{S}$ and $ * \cdot * : \mathbb{Z}_p[X] \times \mathbb{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{S}$ that accommodate two homomorphisms for $[\![ * ]\!]$:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item a \emph{linear homomorphism}: $a \cdot [\![f(X)]\!] + b \cdot [\![g(X)]\!] = [\![af(X) + bg(X)]\!]$
    \item a \emph{monomial homomorphism}: $X^d \cdot [\![f(X)]\!] = [\![X^d f(X)]\!]$.
\end{itemize}
For now, assume both prover and verifier have oracle access to the function $[\![*]\!]$ and to the operations $ * \cdot *$ and $* + *$. (Later on, we will instantiate this commitment function using groups of unknown order and an encoding of polynomials as integers.)

The core idea of the evaluation protocol is to reduce the statement that is being proved from one about a polynomial $f(X)$ of degree $d$ and its evaluation $y = f(z)$, to one about a polynomial $f'(X)$ of degree $d'=\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor$ and its evaluation $y' = f'(z)$. For simplicity, assume that $d+1$ is a power of $2$.
The prover splits $f(X)$ into $f_L(X)$ and $f_R(X)$ such that $f(X) = f_L(X) + X^{d'+1} f_R(X)$ and such that both halves have degree at most $d'$. The prover obtains a random challenge $\alpha \in  \mathbb{Z}_p$ from the verifier and proceeds to prove that $f'(X)=\alpha \cdot f_L(X) + f_R(X)$ has degree $d'$ and that $f'(z) = y' = \alpha y_L + y_R$ with $y_L = f_L(z)$ and $y_R = f_R(z)$. 

The proof repeats this reduction by using $f'(X),z,y'$ and $d'$ as the input to the next recursion step. In the final step, $f(X) = f$ is a constant and the verifier checks that $f=y$.% $f \equiv y \bmod p$. Note that $|f| <  (\frac{p}{2})^{\log_2(d+1)+1}$ so a representation of $f$ requires at most $\lceil \log_2(d+1) \cdot \log_2(p)\rceil$ bits.

The commitment function binds the prover to one particular polynomial for every commitment held by the verifier. In particular, at the start of every recursion step, the verifier is in possession of a commitment $[\![f(X)]\!]$ to $f(X)$. The prover provides commitments $[\![f_L(X)]\!]$ and $[\![f_R(X)]\!]$, and the verifier checks their soundness homomorphically by testing $[\![f(X)]\!] = [\![f_L(X)]\!] + X^{d'+1} \! \cdot \! [\![f_R(X)]\!]$. From these commitments, the verifier can also compute the commitment to $f'(X)$ homomorphically, via $[\![f'(X)]\!] = \alpha \! \cdot \! [\![f_L(X)]\!] + [\![f_R(X)]\!]$. In the last step, the verifier checks that the constant polynomial $f$ matches the commitment by computing $[\![f]\!]$ outright.

\subsection{Integer Polynomial Encoding}

\label{sec:encoding}
We propose using integer commitments in a group of unknown order as a concrete instantiation of the homomorphic commitment scheme required for the abstract protocol presented in Section~\ref{sec:abstraction}. At the heart of our protocol is thus an encoding of integer polynomials with bounded coefficients as integers, which also has homomorphic properties. Any commitment scheme which is homomorphic over integer polynomials is automatically homomorphic over $\ZZ_p[X]$ polynomials as well (by reducing integer polynomials modulo $p$). Polynomials over $\ZZ_p[X]$ can be lifted to integer polynomials in a canonical way by choosing representatives in $[0,p)$. Therefore, from here on we will focus on building a homomorphic integer encoding of integer polynomials, and how to combine this with a homomorphic integer commitment scheme. 

\paragraph{Strawman encoding} In order to encode integer polynomials over an odd prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$, we first lift them to the ring of polynomials over the integers by choosing representatives in $[0,p)$. In the technical overview (Section~\ref{sec:overview}) we noted that a polynomial $f \in \ZZ[X]$ with positive coefficients bounded by $q$ can be encoded as the integer $f(q)$.   
The coefficients of $f$ can be recovered via the base $q$ decomposition of $f(q)$. 
This encoding is an injective mapping from polynomials in $\ZZ[X]$ of degree at most $d$ with positive coefficients less than $q$ to the set $[0, q^{d+1})$. The encoding is also \emph{partially} homomorphic. 
If $f$ is encoded as $f(q)$ and $g$ is encoded as $g(q)$ where coefficients of both $g, f$ are less than $q/2$, then the base-$q$ decomposition of $f(q) + g(q)$ gives back the polynomial $f + g$. 
By choosing a sufficiently large $q \gg p$ it is possible to perform several levels of homomorphic operations on encodings. 

\paragraph{What goes wrong?} Unfortunately, this simple encoding scheme does not quite work yet for the protocol outlined in Section~\ref{sec:overview}. The homomorphic consistency checks ensure that if $[\![f_L(X)]\!]$ is a homomorphic integer commitment to the encoding of $f_L \in \ZZ[X]$, $[\![f_R(X)]\!]$ is a homomorphic integer commitment to the encoding of $f_R \in \ZZ[X]$, and both $f_L, f_R$ are polynomials with $q/2$-bounded integer coefficients, then $[\![f(X)]\!]$ is an integer commitment to the encoding of $f_L + X^{d'}f_R$. (Moreover, if $f_L(z) = y_L \bmod p$ and $f_R(z) = y_R \bmod p$ then $f(z) = y_L + z^{d'} y_R \bmod p$). 

However, the validity of $[\![f_L(X)]\!]$ and $[\![f_R(X)]\!]$ are never checked directly. 
The verifier only sees the opening of the commitment at the bottom level of recursion. If the intermediate encodings use integer polynomials with coefficients larger than $q/2$, or even rational coefficients the homomorphism is not necessarially preserved. Furthermore, even if $[\![f(X)]\!]$ is a commitment to $f^*(q)$ with positive $q$-bounded coefficients, an adversarial prover could find an integer polynomial $g^*$ that does not have positive $q$-bounded coefficients such that $g^*(q) = f^*(q)$ and $g^* \not\equiv f^* \bmod p$ (\emph{i.e}, $g^*$ with coefficients greater than $q$ or negative coefficients). 
The prover could then commit to $g^*_L(q)$ and $g^*_R(q)$, and recurse on $\alpha g^*_L(q) + g^*_R(q)$ instead of $\alpha f^*_L(q) + f^*_R(q)$. This would be non-binding. (For example $f^*(X)= q-1$ and $g^*(X)=X-1$, or $f^*(X) = q +1$ and $g^*(X) = X + 1$). 

\paragraph{Inferring coefficient bounds}\benedikt{Wrong} So what can the verifier infer from the opened commitment $[\![f']\!]$ at the bottom level of recursion? The opened commitment is an integer $f' = \alpha f_L + f_R$. 
From $f'$, the verifier can infer a bounds coefficients of the polynomial $f(X) = f_L + X f_R$, given that $f_L$ and $f_R$ were already committed in the second to last round. The bound holds with overwhelming probability over the randomness of $\alpha \in [0,p)$. This is reasoned as follows: if $f'_0 \leftarrow \alpha_0 f_L + f_R$ and $f'_1 \leftarrow \alpha_1 f_L + f_R$ such that $\max(|f'_0|, |f'_1|) < q / (2p)$ for some distinct $\alpha_0 \neq \alpha_1$, then $|f_L| \leq |f'_1 - f'_0| < q / p$ and $|f_R| \leq |\alpha_0 f'_1 - \alpha_1 f'_0| < q/2$. If no such pair exists, \emph{i.e.} the bound only holds for a unique $\alpha$, then there is a negligibly small probability $1/p$ that $f'$ would have passed the bound check.


\paragraph{What about negative coefficients?} 
As shown above, the verifier can infer a bound on the absolute values of $f_L$ and $f_R$, but still cannot infer that $f_L$ and $f_R$ are both \emph{positive} integers. Moreover, if $f_R > 0$ and $f_L < 0$, then it is still possible that $f_L + q f_R > 0$, and thus that there is a distinct $g \neq f$ with $q$-bounded positive coefficients such that $g(q) = f(q)$. For example, say $f_R = q/2$ and $f_L = -1$ then $f_L + q f_R = q^2/2 - 1$, and $\alpha f_L + f_R  = q/2 - \alpha > 0$ for every $\alpha \in [0,p)$. Yet, also $q^2/2 - 1 = g(q)$ for $g(X) = (q/2 - 1)X + q-1$. 

\paragraph{Ensuring injectivity} How can we ensure the encoding scheme is injective over polynomials with either positive/negative coefficients bounded in absolute value? Fortunately, it is a fact that if $|f_L| < q/2$ and $|f_R| < q/2$ then at least one coefficient of $g$ must be larger than $q/2$. In other words, if the prover had committed instead to $f^*_L$ and $f^*_R$ such that $g(X) = f^*_L + Xf^*_R$ then the verifier could reject the opening of $\alpha \hat{f}^*_L + \hat{f}^*_R$ with overwhelming probability based on its size. 


More generally, for every integer $z$ in the range $B = (-\frac{q^{d+1}}{2}, \frac{q^{d+1}}{2})$ there is a unique degree (at most) $d$ integer polynomial $h(X)$ with coefficients whose absolute values are bounded by $q/2$ such that $h(q) = z$. \emph{We prove this elementary fact below and show how the coefficients of $h$ can be recovered efficiently from $z$ (Fact~\ref{EncodingBijective})}. If the prover is committed to $h(q)$ at level $i$ of the protocol, there is a unique pair of integers polynomial $h_L$ and $h_R$ with coefficients of absolute value bounded by $q/2$ such that $h_L(q) + q^{\frac{d+1}{2}} h_R(q) = h(q)$, and if the prover recurses on any other $h_L^*$ and $h_R^*$ with larger coefficients then the verifier's bound check at the bottom level of recursion will fail with overwhelming probability. 


\paragraph{Final encoding scheme} Let $\ZZ(b):=\{x \in \ZZ: \vert x \vert  \leq b\}$ denote the set of integers with absolute value less than or equal to $b$.  Define $\ZZ(b)[X] := \{f \in \ZZ[X]: ||f||_\infty \leq b\}$, the set of integer polynomials with coefficients from $\ZZ(b)$. (For a polynomial $g \in \ZZ[X]$ the norm $||g||_\infty$ is the maximum over the absolute values of all individual coefficients of $g$.)
\begin{itemize} 

\item \textbf{Encoding.}
For any integer $q$, the function $\mathsf{Enc} : \mathbb{Z}(b)[X] \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ maps $h(X) \mapsto h(q)$. A polynomial $f(X) \in \ZZ_p[X]$ is first mapped to $\ZZ(p-1)[X]$ by replacing each coefficient of $f$ with its unique integer representative from $[0,p)$ of the same equivalence class modulo $p$.  %This means the map can be used as encoding of polynomials in the domain $\ZZ(b)[X]$ with $b<q/2$.

\item \textbf{Decoding.}
Decoding works as follows. Define the partial sum $S_k := \sum_{i=0}^k f_i q^i$ with $S_{-1} := 0$. Assuming $|f_i| < q/2$ for all $i$, observe that for any partial sum $S_k$ we have $|S_k|<\frac{q^{k+1}}{2}$. Therefore, when $S_k < 0$ then $S_k \bmod q^{k+1} > q^{k+1}/2$ and when $S_k \geq 0$ then $S_k \bmod q^{k+1} < q^{k+1}/2$. 
This leads to a decoding strategy for recovering $S_k$ from $y \in \mathbb{Z}$. The decode algorithm sets $S_k$ to $y \bmod q^{k+1}$ if this value is less than $q^{k+1}/2$ and to $q^{k+1}- (y \bmod q^{k+1})$ otherwise.
Two consecutive partial sums yield a coefficient of $f(X)$: $f_k = \frac{S_{k} - S_{k-1}}{q^{k}} \in \ZZ(b)$. These operations give rise to the following algorithm.\\

\begin{fact} \label{EncodingBijective}
Let $q$ be an odd integer. For any $z$ in the range $B = (-\frac{q^{d+1}}{2}, \frac{q^{d+1}}{2})$ there is a unique degree (at most) $d$ integer polynomial $h(X)$ in $\ZZ(\frac{q-1}{2})[X]$ such that $h(q) = z$. 
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
Given any degree (at most) $d$ integer polynomial $f \in \ZZ(\frac{q-1}{2})$, by construction we see that $\pro{Dec}(\pro{Enc}(f)) = f$. Therefore, $\pro{Enc}$ is an injective map from degree (at most) $d$ polynomials in $\ZZ(\frac{q-1}{2})[X]$ to $B$. Furthermore, the cardinality of both the domain and range of this map is $q^{d+1}$. This shows that the map is surjective. In conclusion, the map is bijective. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Concrete Polynomial Commitment Scheme}
\label{subsec:concretepoly}
We now instantiate the abstract homomorphic commitment function $[\![ * ]\!]$. To this end we sample a group of unknown order $\mathbb{G}$, and sample a random element $\gr{g}$ from this group. 
Lift the field polynomial $f(X)\in \ZZ_p[X]$ to an integer polynomial with bounded coefficients, \emph{i.e.}, $\hat{f}(X)\in \ZZ(p-1)[X]$ such that $\hat{f}(X)\bmod p=f(x)$.
We encode $\hat{f}(X)$ as an integer by evaluating it at a ``large enough'' integer $q$. Finally, we use scalar multiplication in $\GG$ to commit to the integer. Therefore, $[\![f(X)]\!]$, corresponds to $\hat{f}(q)\cdot \gr{g}$. This commitment function inherits the homomorphic properties of the integer encoding for a limited number of additions and multiplications-by-constant. The monomial homomorphism for $X^d$ is achieved by raising the group element to the power $q^{d}$. To maintain consistency between the prover's witness polynomials and the verifier's commitments, the prover operates on polynomials with integer coefficients  $\hat{f}(X), \hat{g}(X)$, \emph{etc.}, without ever reducing them modulo $p$.

The $\setup, \pro{Commit}$ and $\open$ functionalities are presented formally below. Note that the scheme is parameterized by $p$ and $q$.
%; these values are determined by the context and independently of $\setup$.

%We now present our main technical contribution: a polynomial commitment scheme with an efficient evaluation protocol based on a group of unknown order $\GG$. For polynomials of degree $d=\poly$ the evaluation protocol uses $1+\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil$ rounds and $O(\log(d))$ communication and verifier work.

%Exponentiation in groups of unknown order is a succinct and homomorphic cryptographic commitments to an integer.
%Using the integer encoding of polynomials, or their encoding as dyadic rationals, above we can simply commit to a polynomial $f(X)$ with bounded coefficients by computing $\gr{g}^{f(q)} \in \GG$. Every polynomial in $\ZZ_p[X]$ naturally maps to an integer polynomial with coefficients in $B_{\frac{p-1}{2}}$. The commitment scheme, therefore, supports committing to polynomials in $\ZZ_p[X]$ for $p \leq q$. Interestingly, neither $p$ nor the degree $d$ need to be specified in the setup. 

%As long as $q$ and ``big enough'' they can be freely chosen.\alan{Todo: make this observation elsewhere.} %In class groups there is an efficient algorithm to compute square roots, and as a result, a prover can also commit to dyadic rationals. Since every dyadic rational corresponds to a unique element in $\ZZ_p$ we can simply extend the encoding to work for polynomials with bounded dyadic rational coefficients. The only difference is that we require $q$ to be odd such that the prover cannot commit to polynomials with negative powers. We will discuss the relationship between $p$, $d$ and $q$ in more detail later but first we describe the setup, commitment and opening algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\pro{Setup}(1^\secpar):$ Sample $ \GG \sample \ggen(\secpar)$
			and $ \gr{g} \sample \GG$. Return $\params = (\secpar,\GG,\gr{g}, q)$.
\item $\pro{Commit}(\params;f(X) \in \ZZ_p[X]):$ Compute $\gr{C} \gets {\hat{f}(q)}\cdot \gr{g}$ and return $(\gr{C};f(X),\hat{f}(X))$.
\item $\pro{Open}(\params,\gr{C}, f(X), \hat{f}(X)):$ Check that $\hat{f}(X)\in \ZZ(q/2)[X]$ and ${\hat{f}(q)}\cdot \gr{g} = \gr{C}$ and $f(X) = \hat{f}(X) \bmod p$.

%Opening the commitment can be simply done by rerunning the commitment algorithm. Additionally a proof of exponentiation (PoE) can be used to increase verifier efficiency.
%The commitment inherits the homomorphic properties of the integer encoding. Assume that we are committing to representations of polynomials in $\ZZ_p[X]$, \emph{i.e.}, polynomials with coefficients bounded by $p$. Then the commitment scheme supports up to $\frac{q}{p}$ homomorphic additions. Equivalently, when raising a commitment to a weight $\alpha$, the size of the coefficients grows by at most a factor of $|\alpha|$. We use this property to build an efficient $\eval$ protocol. 

%The core idea of the $\eval$ protocol is to reduce the statement from one about a polynomial $f(X)$ of degree $d$ to one about a polynomial of degree $d'=\frac{d+1}{2}-1$. For simplicity assume that $d+1$ is a power of $2$.
%The prover splits $f(X)$ into $f_L(X)$ and $f_R(X)$ such that $f(X) = f_L(X)+X^{d'+1} f_R(X)$ and such that both polynomials have degree at most $d'$. Then he proves that $f'(X)=\alpha \cdot f_L(X) + f_R(X)$ has degree $d'$ for a random challenge $\alpha\in [-\frac{p-1}{2},\frac{p-1}{2}]$. 

%If the prover wants to show, in addition to the previous, that $f(z)=y\bmod p$, then he can simply provide $y_L=f_L(z)\bmod p$ and $y_R=f_R(z)\bmod p$ and show that $y_L + z^{d'+1} \cdot y_R \bmod p=y$. Note that the verifier can compute $y' = f'(z) = \alpha \cdot y_L + y_R \bmod p$ from $y_L$ and $y_R$.

%The proof recursively repeats this reduction by using $f'(X),z,y'$ and $d'$ as the input. In the final step, the prover simply sends the constant polynomial $f$ and the verifier can check that $f \equiv y \bmod p$. Note that $|f|< (\frac{p}{2})^{\log_2(d+1)+1}$ so an integer encoding of $f_0$ requires at most $\lceil \log_2(d+1) \cdot \log_2(p)\rceil$ bits. 
\paragraph{Evaluation protocol}
Using the cryptographic compilation of the information theoretic protocol we get an $\eval$ protocol with logarithmic communication. In every round, however, the verifier needs to check consistency between $[\![f_L(X)]\!],[\![f_R(X)]\!]$ and $[\![f(X)]\!]$. This is done by checking that $\gr{C}_L + q^{d'+1} \cdot \gr{C}_R=\gr{C}$. This naive check is highly inefficient as the exponent $q^{d'+1}$ has $O(d)$ bits.
%For the concrete evaluation protocol, one starts with the situation in which the verifier possesses a commitment to $f(X)$ in the form of $\gr{C} = \gr{g}^{f(q)}$. The prover commits to $f_L(X)$ and $f_R(X)$ by sending $\gr{C}_L$ and $\gr{C}_R$. The verifier checks that $\gr{C} = \gr{C}_L \cdot \gr{C}_R^{q^{d'+1}}$ and proceeds in the next step with the commitment $\gr{C}' = \gr{C}_L^\alpha \cdot \gr{C}_R$ to $f'(X)$. This instantiation produces an $\eval$ protocol with logarithmic communication. However, naïvely checking that $f(X) = f_L(X) + X^{d'+1} f_R(X)$ based on the commitments $\gr{C}, \gr{C}_L$ and $\gr{C}_R$ is inefficient because the bit-size of the exponent $q^{d'+1}$ is huge.
To resolve this inefficiency, we utilize a proof of exponentiation (\textsf{PoE})~\cite{ITCS:Pietrzak18,EC:Wesolowski19} to outsource the computation to the prover.
The \textsf{PoE} protocol is an argument that a large scalar multiplication in a group of unknown order was performed correctly. Wesolowski's \textsf{PoE}~\cite{EC:Wesolowski19} is public coin, has constant communication and verification time, and is thus particularly well-suited here.

We now specify subtleties that were previously glossed over. 
%First, we handle the case where $d+1$ is not a power of 2.  Whenever $d+1$ is odd in the recursion, the polynomial is shifted by one degree --- specifically, $f'(X) = X f(X)$ and the protocol proceeds to prove that $f'(X)$ has degree bounded by $d' = d+1$ and evaluates to $y' = zy$ at $z$. The verifier obtains the matching commitment $\gr{C}'\gets q \cdot \gr{C}$.

The coefficients of $f(X)$ grow by a factor of $2^\lambda$ in every recursion step, but eventually, the transmitted constant $f$ has to be tested against some bound because if it is \emph{too large} it should be rejected. However, the function interface provides no option to specify the allowable size of coefficients. We therefore define and use a subroutine $\pro{EvalB}$, which takes an additional argument $b$ and which proves, in addition to what $\pro{Eval}$ proves, that all coefficients $f_i$ of $f(X)$ satisfy $|f_i| \leq b$. Importantly, $b$ grows by a factor for $2^\lambda$, the challenge space, in every recursion step. This subroutine is also useful if commitments were homomorphically combined prior to the execution of $\pro{EvalB}$. The growth of these coefficients determines a lower bound on $q$: $q$ needs to be \emph{significantly} larger than $b$ for security. Exactly which factor constitutes ``significantly'' is determined by the knowledge-soundness proof.

In the final round we check that the constant $f$ satisfies $|f|\leq b$ and the protocol's correctness is guaranteed if $b = (p-1)\cdot 2^{\lambda \mu}$, where $\mu=\log(d+1)$ are the number of rounds. However, $q$ needs to be even larger than this value in order for extraction to work (and hence, for the proof of witness-extended emulation to go through). The precise value of $q$ depends on the number of rounds $\mu$, and is defined in \Cref{thm:darkisdarkss} and is $2^{O(\mu \lambda)}$.

 We now present the full, formal $\eval$ protocol below. It is restricted such that $d+1$ is a power of $2$. Given the monomial homomorphism of the commitment scheme, it is easy to pad any polynomial to a power of $2$ by computing $C\gets q^{\Delta} \cdot C$ for $\Delta=2^{\lceil \log_2(d+1) \rceil}-1-d$ and setting the evaluation to $z^\Delta \cdot y$. The verification of this step can be outsourced using a $\textsf{PoE}$.

\subsection{Security Analysis} 
The new security analysis is in a self-contained document in the appendix. We, briefly, restate the main lemmas and theorems but refer the reader to the appendix for more details. 

We show in \Cref{lem:darkcommit} that the DARK polynomial commitment scheme is binding. 
\newcommand{\correctnesslemma}{
The polynomial commitment scheme is correct for polynomials in $\ZZ_p[X]$ of degree at most $d$.
}
 
 \begin{lemma}
 	\label{lem:correctness}
\correctnesslemma
 \end{lemma}


The proofs of this lemmas is in Appendix~\ref{sec:darksoundness}.
Next is the main security theorem, which states that the evaluation protocol has witness-extended emulation.







%We are now in a position to prove the main security statement.

\newcommand{\maintheorem}{
	Let $\CSZ = 8 \mu^{2} + \log_2 (2 \mu) \lambda$\footnote{This value can be replaced with values from the table in \Cref{lem:cCSZ}}. Let $\EBL=\lambda\cdot \mu$ and $\CorrectnessBound=\lambda\cdot \mu+\log_2 p$. Let $\com$ be the DARK commitment scheme as described in \Cref{lem:darkcommit}. There exists a pair of predicates $\phi$ such that the $\mu$-round DARK polynomial commitment evaluation protocol $\eval'$ with $\lambda$-bit challenges, a group of unknown order $\ggen$, and $\log q \geq 4(\lambda + 1 + \CSZ[\mu]) + \EBL[\mu] + \CorrectnessBound + 1$ is $(2^{(\mu)}, \frac{3\mu}{2^\lambda},\com,\phi)$-DARK-special sound. 

As a corollary, under the adaptive root assumption for $\ggen$, the DARK polynomial commitment scheme with the same parameters has witness-extended-emulation (\Cref{def:wee}).
}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:darkisdarkss} 
\maintheorem
\end{theorem} 



%\textit{Remark:}
%The bound on $q$ for correctness (Lemma \ref{lem:correctness}) is $O((\frac{p}{2})^{\log(d)})$ while the bound for soundness is $O((\frac{p}{2})^{2 \log(d)})$. It is not clear whether this gap can be closed. While the soundness analysis is tight for the worst case assumption on challenges it is possible that a probabilistic analysis could give a tighter result.

\subsection{Performance}
The polynomial commitment scheme has logarithmic proof size and verifier time in the degree $d$ of the committed polynomial. 
It has highly batchable proofs and it is possible to evaluate $n$ degree $d$ polynomials at $k$ points using only $2\log_2(d+1)$ group elements and $(k+1)\log_2(d+1)$ field elements (see Section \ref{subsec:optimization}). Note that this means the proof size is independent of $n$ and linear in $k$ but with a small constant $(15 \log(d)$ bytes). 
We describe the performance of our scheme for different settings in Table~\ref{tab:performance}.

\subsection{Comparison to Other Polynomial Commitment Schemes}

\subsubsection{Based on Pairings}

The polynomial commitment by Kate~\emph{et al.}~\cite{AC:KatZavGol10} has evaluation proofs that consist of only a single element in a bilinear group and verifying an evaluation requires only a single pairing computation. However, this asymptotically optimal performance comes at the cost of a trusted setup procedure that outputs a structured reference string whose size is linear in the degree of the polynomial. Our DARK polynomial commitment scheme requires no trusted setup but pays for this reduced trust requirement with a proof size and verification work that scale logarithmically in the degree of the polynomial.

In the multivariate setting, our scheme is logarithmic in the total number of coefficients: $\mu\log(d)$ for a $\mu$-variate polynomial of degree $d$ in each variable. The multivariate extension of Kate~\emph{et al.}'s commitment scheme~\cite{SP:ZGKPP17} evaluation proofs consist of $\mu$ group elements.

\subsubsection{Based on Discrete Logarithms}

\textsf{Bulletproofs}~\cite{EC:BCCGP16,SP:BBBPWM18} is a proof system based on prime order groups in which the discrete logarithm is hard. As a core component it relies on an inner product argument which can be used as a polynomial commitment (see \cite{SP:WTSTW18}). The polynomial commitment has logarithmic evaluation proofs with great constants. Unfortunately, the verifier time is linear in the size of the polynomial, i.e. $(d+1)^\mu$ for a $\mu$- variate degree $d$ polynomial.
The more general version of the commitment~\cite{EC:BCCGP16} can also give evaluation proofs with square root verifier time and square root proof size.


\subsubsection{Based on Merkle Trees of Reed-Solomon Codewords} \label{subsection:fri}

The FRI protocol~\cite{ICALP:BBHR18} is an efficient interactive oracle proof (IOP) that a committed oracle is close to a Reed-Solomon codeword, meaning that the prover commits to large sequences of field elements and the verifier queries only a few specific elements rather than reading the entire sequence. The abstract functionality is cryptographically compiled with a Merkle tree, which results in constant-size commitments and element queries that are logarithmic in the length of the codeword, \emph{i.e.}, the size of the oracle. FRI has been used in multiple recent zero-knowledge proof systems such as  \textsf{STARK}~\cite{C:BBHR19}, \textsf{Aurora}~\cite{EC:BCRSVW19}, and \textsf{Fractal}~\cite{Fractal}.

Since this oracle is a Reed-Solomon codeword, it represents the evaluations of a low-degree polynomial $f$ on an evaluation set $S \subset \FF$. In order to be used as a polynomial commitment scheme, the protocol needs to permit querying the polynomial outside of the evaluation set. DEEP-FRI~\cite{DEEPFRI} shows that this is possible and two recent works~\cite{EPRINT:ZXZS19,EPRINT:KatPanVla19} makes the connection explicit by building a polynomial commitment scheme from FRI. 
This FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme have evaluation proofs of size and verifier time $O(\lambda \log^2(d))$ where $\lambda$ is the security parameter and $d = \deg(f)$. To date, no extension to multivariate polynomials exists for FRI. The commitment relies only on symmetric cryptography and is plausibly quantum resistant.

\subsubsection{Comparison}

In Table \ref{tab:polycommit} we give a comparison between different polynomial commitment schemes in the literature. In particular, we evaluate the size of the reference string ($|\params|$), the prover and verifier time, as well as the size of the evaluation proof ($|\pi|$). Column $2$ indicates whether the setup is transparent, \emph{i.e.}, whether the reference string is structured. The symbol $\GG_U$ denotes a group of unknown order, $\GG_{B}$ a group with a bilinear map (pairing), and $\GG_{P}$ a group with prime (and known) order. Furthermore, $\textsf{MUL}$ refers to scalar multiplications of a $\lambda$ bit number in these groups, and $\hash$ is either the size of a hash output, or the time it takes to compute a hash, depending on context. 

Note that even when precise factors are given, the numbers should be interpreted as estimates. For example we chose to not display smaller order terms.
Note also that the prover time for the group based schemes could be brought down by a log factor when using multi-scalar multiplication techniques.

\begin{comment}
	Multiple recent concrete proof systems such as use probabilistic testing of Reed-Solomon codes as
Recent years have seen a flurry of developments related to probabilistic testing of Reed-Solomon code membership~\cite{SIAMCOMP:BS08,STOC:BCGT13,ECCC:BGR16,ICALP:BBHR18,DEEPFRI}. Of these developments, the FRI~\cite{ICALP:BBHR18} protocol and its improvement DEEP-FRI~\cite{DEEPFRI} have seen deployment in concrete proof systems such as \textsf{STARK}~\cite{C:BBHR19}, \textsf{Aurora}~\cite{EC:BCRSVW19}, and \textsf{Fractal}~\cite{Fractal}. While these general purpose zero-knowledge proof systems do not use FRI as a polynomial commitment scheme, FRI does admit an interpretation as a one, as explained in a recent eprint note~\cite{MatterLabs}. In addition to that, mechanics that make FRI work are somewhat similar to the mechanics underlying our DARK polynomial evaluation protocol.

FRI stands for \emph{\underline{F}ast \underline{R}eed-Solomon \underline{I}OPP}, where IOPP stands for \emph{\underline{I}nteractive \underline{O}racle \underline{P}roof of \underline{P}roximity}. In such an information theoretical proof system, the prover sends sequences of field elements to the verifier and the verifier, rather than reading every sequence in its entirety, reads a select few random field elements from each sequence before sending a challenge back. At the end of the protocol the verifier should accept if the first sequence belongs to a given code, and he should reject if it is far from the code, under some precise definition of distance. We do not care what happens if the sequence has a small but nonzero distance from the nearest codeword. In order to simulate the verifier's random access in a concrete setting, the protocol is typically cryptographically compiled by representing every sequence as a Merkle tree: the prover sends the Merkle root, the verifier selects a random index, and the prover provides the authentication path for the field element located at that index.

A Reed-Solomon code $\mathsf{RS}[\mathbb{F}, S, \rho]$ is the set sequences of length $N = |S|$ of evaluations of some polynomial $f(X) \in \mathbb{F}[X]$ of degree at most $d < \rho N$ on an evaluation set $S \subset \mathbb{F}$. The rate parameter $\rho \in (0; 1]$ is typically 1/8 or on that order of magnitude. Note that \emph{any} Reed-Solomon IOPP can be turned into a polynomial commitment scheme. If it is true that $f(z) = y$ for some $z,y \in \mathbb{F}$ known to the verifier, then $X-z$ divides $f(X)-y$ and the relation for $f'(X) = \frac{f(X)-y}{X-z}$ can be probabilistically tested by reading the codewords for $f$ and $f'$ in a random $s \in S$. Moreover, $f'$ has degree at most $d-1$, so the protocol can recurse to prove that the codeword of $f'$ belongs to a \emph{smaller} code.

While Reed-Solomon IOPPs naturally extend to polynomial evaluation proofs, and hence to polynomial commitment schemes, for many purposes this extension is overkill. It suffices instead to prove membership in the code, or in other words, to establish a bound on the degree of the polynomial $f(X)$. FRI establishes this bound as follows. Let $S$ be a multiplicative subgroup of even order of $\mathbb{F} \backslash \{0\}$. In every iteration, the working polynomial $f(X)$ is split into two polynomials of degree at most $d' = \frac{d+1}{2}-1$, namely $f_E(X)$ and $f_O(X)$, such that $f(X) = f_E(X^2) + Xf_O(X^2)$. The verifier chooses a random weight $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}$ and the prover responds with (a Merkle tree commitment to the codeword matching) the polynomial $f'(X) = f_E(X) + \alpha f_O(X)$. Observe that for any square\footnote{In binary fields, where non-squares do not exist, the polynomial $f(X)$ is split into two halves based on a different two-to-one map from $X \mapsto X^2$; as such, $y, s_0, s_1$ and $S$ must be chosen accordingly.} $y \in \mathbb{F}$ and distinct square roots $s_0, s_1$ of $y$, the points 
\begin{flalign*}
    (s_0, f(s_0)) &= (s_0, f_E(y) + s_0f_O(y)) \\
    (s_1, f(s_1)) &= (s_1, f_E(y) + s_1f_O(y)) \\
    (\alpha, f'(y)) &= (\alpha, f_E(y) + \alpha f_O(y))
\end{flalign*}
lie on a straight line. The verifier can probabilistically test this collinearity by sampling $s_0, s_1, y \in S$ such that $s_0^2 = s_1^2 = y$, and querying the codewords. If this consistency test passes, the protocol recurses to establish that $f'(X)$ has degree at most $d'$. In the final round, $f'$ is a constant and is sent to the verifier.

Compared to our DARK evaluation protocol, the recursion principle is similar: split the working polynomial into two halves and combine them with a random weight. However, the consistency check is starkly different and matches the cryptographic tools that enable the compact representation of arbitrarily large polynomials, \emph{i.e.}, Merkle trees of Reed-Solomon codewords versus integer commitments in a group of unknown order. As a result, FRI has $O((\log d)^2)$ proof size and verifier time, whereas for DARK these quantities are only $O(\log d)$. Neither scheme requires a trusted setup. To date, FRI has no support for multivariate polynomials whereas for DARK this support is native.
