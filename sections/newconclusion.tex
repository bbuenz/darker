In this work we present DARK proofs, a polynomial commitment scheme from falsifiable assumptions in groups of unknown order with evaluation proofs that can be verified in logarithmic time. We also present a unifying information-theoretical framework underlying several recent SNARK constructions called Polynomial-IOPs. Polynomial-IOPs can be compiled to a concrete SNARK using a polynomial commitment scheme and the Fiat-Shamir transform. We show that using the DARK protocol this gives us the first practical SNARK without
trusted setup and only logarithmic verification time. Unlike all known SNARKs in bilinear groups the construction does not require knowledge of exponent assumptions.
Several important open questions remain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our polynomial commitment scheme has prover time linear in the total number of coefficients, even for zero coefficients. Consequently for a sparse bivariate polynomial of degree $d$ in each variable the prover time is quadratic in $d$. A sparse polynomial commitment scheme would directly enable an efficient compilation of simple information theoretic protocols such as QAPs.
    \item Assymptotically the Supersonic's prover time is on par with pairing-based SNARK construction. A concrete implementation and comparison remains open.
    \item This work further motivates the study of class groups and groups of unknown order. In particular we rely on a recently introduced adaptive root assumption.
    \item Our polynomial commitment scheme uses a simple underlying information theoretic protocol. Different cryptographic compilations of this scheme under different assumptions would directly yield interesting SNARK constructions. 
\end{itemize}
