\section{Security Proofs}
\label{appendix:hardness}
In the preliminaries we already stated the two main hardness assumptions, the $r$-Strong RSA Assumption and the Adaptive Root Assumption.
\input{sections/hardness}

\subsection{Binding}
\label{appendix:binding}
%\def\thelemma{\ref{lem:binding}}
\newtheorem*{lemmabinding}{Lemma \ref{lem:binding}}
\begin{lemmabinding}
	\bindinglemma
\end{lemmabinding}
\begin{proof}
    Assume that there is an adversary that breaks the binding property of the scheme. Specifically, assume that some probabilistic polynomial time algorithm $\adv$ takes as input $\params$ and outputs $\gr{C} \in \GG, f(X) \in \ZZ(b)[X], f'(X)\in \ZZ(b)[X]$ such that with non-negligble probability $\pro{Open}(\params, \gr{C}, \tilde{f}(X), f(X)) = \pro{Open}(\params, \gr{C}, \tilde{f'}(X), f'(X)) = 1$ and $\tilde{f}(X) \neq \tilde{f'}(X)$. We proceed to show that this implies a violation of the Order Assumption~(Assumption \ref{assum:order}) and the Strong RSA Assumption~(Assumption \ref{assum:strongRSA}). The assumptions are incomparable so we show that either suffices to achieve the binding property of the commitment scheme.
    
	If $f(X)\neq f'(X)$ and $q/2>b$ then $f(q)\neq f'(q)\in \ZZ$. Since $\gr{g}^{f(q)}=\gr{g}^{f'(q)}=\gr{C}$ we have that $\gr{g}^{f(q)-f'(q)}=1$. This directly breaks the Order Assumption and we can also create an adversary $\adv_{RSA}$ that breaks the Strong RSA Assumption. To do so the $\adv_{RSA}$ picks an odd prime $\ell$ that is co-prime with $f(q)-f'(q)$ and computes $\gr{u}\gets \gr{g}^{\ell^{-1} \bmod (f(q)-f'(q))}$ as the $\ell$th root of $\gr{g}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Correctness}
\label{appendix:correctness}

%\def\thelemma{\ref{lem:correctness}}
\newtheorem*{lemmacorrectness}{Lemma \ref{lem:correctness}}
\begin{lemmacorrectness}
	\correctnesslemma
\end{lemmacorrectness}

\begin{proof}
In order to ensure correctness we must ensure that $b< q/2$ and that $|f|\leq b$. To show this we show that in each recursion step the honest prover's witness polynomial has coefficients bounded by $b$ and has degree $d$. 
We argue inductively that for each recursive call of $\pro{EvalBounded}$ the following constraints on the inputs are satisfied: The degree of $f(X)$ is bounded by $d$. $\gr{C}$ encodes the polynomial, \emph{i.e.}, $\gr{C}=\gr{g}^{f(q)}$ and $f(X)\in \ZZ(b)$. Also $f(z) = y\bmod p$.

Initially, during the execution of $\eval$, the prover maps the coefficients of a polynomial $\tilde{f}(X)\in \ZZ_p$ to an integer polynomial $f(X)$ with coefficients in $\ZZ(\frac{p-1}{2})$ and degree at most $d$ such that $\gr{C}=\gr{g}^{f(q)}$. Additionally $f(z)\bmod p=\tilde{f}(z)=y$.

 In a recursion steps where $d+1$ is odd, $f'(X)=X\cdot f(X)$ is a polynomial of degree $d+1$ such that $\gr{C}'=\gr{C}^q=\gr{g}^{q\cdot f(q)}=\gr{g}^{f'(X)}$ and the bound $b$ is unchanged as are the coefficients. Also, $f'(z)\bmod p = z \cdot f(z) \bmod p=z\cdot y\bmod p = y' \bmod p$. If $d+1$ is odd, then in the next step $d+1$ must be even.
 
 If $d+1$ is even then, $\prover$ computes $f_L(X)$ and $f_R(X)$ such that $f_L(X)+X^{\frac{d+1}{2}} f_R(X)=f(X)$. Consequently $f(z) \bmod p=f_L(z)+ z^{\frac{d+1}{2}} f_R(z)\bmod p=y_L+z^{\frac{d+1}{2}}  y_R\bmod p =y$. The \textsf{PoE} protocol has perfect correctness so {$\gr{g}^{f_L(q)+q^{\frac{d+1}{2}} f_R(X)}=\gr{C}$}.
 %\gr{C}_L\gr{C}_R^{(q^{\frac{d+1}{2}})}
 Finally $f'(X)=\alpha f_L(X) + f_R(X)\in \ZZ(\frac{p+1}{2}\cdot b)$ is a degree $d$ polynomial with coefficients bounded in absolute value by $(\frac{p+1}{2})\cdot b$. This is precisely the value of $b'$ the input to the next call of $\pro{EvalBounded}$. The value $y'$ is also correct:
$f'(z)\bmod p=\alpha f_L(z) +f_R(z) \bmod p= \alpha y_L +y_R\bmod p=y'$
 
 There are exactly $\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil$ recursion steps with even $d+1$. In the final recursion step we therefore have $b=\frac{p-1}{2}(\frac{p+1}{2})^{\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil}$ and as such the requirement that $q/2>\frac{p-1}{2}(\frac{p+1}{2})^{\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil}$. 
 So if $q>p^{\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil+1}\geq (p-1) (\frac{p+1}{2})^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil}$ then all verifier checks pass and the verifier outputs $1$.
\end{proof} 


\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:polycommitsecurity}}
\label{appendix:maintheoremproof}

\paragraph{Security of $\textsf{PoE}$ substitutions}
We first begin by showing that we can safely replace all of the $\textsf{PoE}$ evaluations with direct verification checks. Concretely, under the Adaptive Root Assumption, the $\eval$ protocol is as secure as the protocol $\eval'$ in which all $\textsf{PoE}$s are replaced by direct checks. We show that the witness-extended emulation for $\eval'$ implies the same property for $\eval$. This is useful because we will later show how to can build an extractor for $\eval'$, thereby showing that the same witness-extended emulation property extends to $\eval$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:poe_security}
Let $\eval'$ be the protocol that is identical to $\eval$ but in line \ref{line:PoE} of $\pro{EvalBounded}$ $\verifier$ directly checks $\gr{C}_L\gr{C}_R^{q^{d'+1}}=\gr{C}$ instead of using a $\textsf{PoE}$. If the Adaptive Root Assumption holds for $\ggen$, and $\eval'$ has witness-extended emulation for polynomials of degree $d=\poly$, then so does $\eval$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We show that if an extractor $E'$, as defined in Definition~\ref{def:wee}, exists for the protocol $\eval'$ then we can construct an extractor $E$ for the protocol $\eval$. Specifically, $E$ simulates $E'$ and presents it with a $\pro{Record}'(\cdots)$ oracle, while extracting the witness from its own $\pro{Record}(\cdots)$ oracle.

Whenever $E'$ queries the $\pro{Record}'$ oracle, $E$ queries its $\pro{Record}$ oracle and relays the response after dropping those portions of the transcript that correspond to the $\mathsf{PoE}$ proofs. Whenever $E'$ rewinds its prover, so does $E$ rewind its prover. When $E'$ terminates by outputting a transcript-and-witness pair $(\mathsf{tr}', f(X))$, $E$ adds $\mathsf{PoE}$s into this transcript to obtain $\mathsf{tr}$ and outputs $(\mathsf{tr}, f(X))$.

For each PPT adversary $(\adv,P^*)$, $E$ will receive a polynomial number of transcripts from its $\pro{Record}$ oracle. Any transcript $\tr$ of $\eval$ such that $\adv(\tr)=1$ and $\tr$ is accepting contains exactly $\lceil \log(d+1)\rceil$ $\textsf{PoE}s$ transcripts. 
So in total $E$ sees only a polynomial number of $\textsf{PoE}$ transcripts generated by a probabilistic polynomial-time prover and verifier. By Lemma~\ref{lem:poe} under the Adaptive Root Assumption, the probability that a polynomial time adversary can break the soundness of $\textsf{PoE}$, \emph{i.e.}, convince a verifier on an instance $(\gr{C}_R,\gr{C}/\gr{C}_{L},q^{d'+1})\not\in\mathcal{R}_{\textsf{PoE}}$, is negligible. 
Consequently, the probability that the adversary can break $\textsf{PoE}$ on \emph{any} of the polynomial number of executions of $\mathsf{PoE}$ is still negligible.

This means that with overwhelming probability all transcripts are equivalent to having the verifier directly check $(\gr{C}_R,\gr{C}/\gr{C}_{L},q^{d'+1})\in\mathcal{R}_{\textsf{PoE}}$. By assumption, the witness-candidate $f(X)$ that $E'$ outputs is a valid witness if the transcript $\mathsf{tr}'$ that $E'$ also outputs is accepting. The addition of honest $\mathsf{PoE}$ transcripts to $\mathsf{tr}'$ preserves the transcript's validity. So $\mathsf{tr}$ is an accepting transcript for $\pro{Eval}$ if and only if $\mathsf{tr}'$ is an accepting transcript for $\pro{Eval}'$. Therefore, $E'$ outputs a valid witness $f(X)$ whenever $E$ outputs a valid witness. This suffices to show that $\pro{Eval}$ has witness-extended emulation if $\pro{Eval}'$ has, and if the Adaptive Root Assumption holds for $\ggen$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Combining statements.} The $\eval$ protocol combines two statements into one by using a random linear combination of group elements, \emph{i.e.}, $\gr{C}'\gets \gr{C}_L^{\alpha}\gr{C}_R$. We now show that this step is sound and that given the discrete logarithm for $\gr{C}'$ the extractor can extract the discrete logarithm for $\gr{C}_L$ and $\gr{C}_R$ we also show that the we can bound the size of the discrete logarithm. We show that this statement holds in two settings. First we consider a group $\GG$ were the standard Strong RSA Assumption holds and group elements are encodings of integers. 
%Move next part to after lemma?
Then we will show that in groups in which taking square roots is easy we can extract dyadic rationals using the 2-Strong RSA Assumption.
 %For $\GG \gets \ggen(\lambda)$, and $\gr{g}\sample \GG$. Let $(\gr{C}_L\in \GG,\gr{C}_R\in \GG,\alpha\in [0,p-1],f\in [0,b];\gr{g}^{f}=\gr{C}_L^{\alpha}\gr{C}_R)$ and  $(\gr{C}_L,\gr{C}_R,\alpha'\in [0,p-1],f'\in [0,b];\gr{g}^{f'}=\gr{C}_L^{\alpha'}\gr{C}_R)$  be two transcripts for $\alpha\neq \alpha'$.
\begin{lemma}[Combining for integer witnesses]
\label{lem:intrandomcombine}
	For $\GG \gets \ggen(\lambda)$, and $\gr{g}\sample \GG$. 
	Let $(z,\gr{C}_L,\gr{C}_R,y_L,y_R,\alpha,f,y)$ and  $(z,\gr{C}_L,\gr{C}_R,y_L,y_R,\alpha',f',y')$ be two transcripts such that $\gr{g}^{f}=\gr{C}_L^{\alpha}\gr{C}_R$ and $\gr{g}^{f'}=\gr{C}_L^{\alpha'}\gr{C}_R$ for group elements $\gr{C}_L,\gr{C}_R \in \GG$, and integers $\alpha,\alpha' \in  [-\frac{p-1}{2},\frac{p-1}{2}]$, $\alpha\neq \alpha'$. Further let $f,f'\in \ZZ$ be such that $f(X)\gets\dec(f)$ and $f'(X)\gets\dec(f')$ are degree $d$ bounded polynomials with coefficients bounded by $b$, \emph{i.e.}, $f(X),f'(X)\in \ZZ(b)[X]\subset \ZZ[X]$. And finally let $y=f(z)\bmod p$ and $y'=f'(z)\bmod p$.
	 Then there exists a PPT algorithm $\mathcal{X}$ that given these transcripts computes either (1) $y_L,y_R\in \ZZ_p,f_L(X),f_R(X)\in \ZZ((p-1) \cdot b)[X]$  such that $f_L(z)=y_L\bmod p$ and $f_R(z)=y_R \bmod p$ or (2) an element in $\GG$ of known order or (3) a fractional root of $\gr{g}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Using the transcripts $\mathcal{X}$ computes $\Delta_\alpha\gets\alpha-\alpha'$ and $\Delta_f\gets f-f'$ such that $\gr{C}_{L}^{\Delta_\alpha}=\gr{g}^{\Delta_f}$. 
 If $\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}$ is not an integer then $\mathcal{X}$ outputs a fractional root of $\gr{g}$, that is the tuple $(\Delta_f,\Delta_\alpha,\gr{C}_{L})$.  
 If $\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}$ on the other hand is an integer then $\mathcal{X}$ can compute $\gr{D}\gets\gr{g}^{\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}}$. Either $\gr{D}=\gr{C}_{L}$ or $(\gr{D}/\gr{C}_{L})^{\Delta_\alpha}=1$. In the second case, $\gr{D}/\gr{C}_{L}$ is an element of known order.
   
  Otherwise $\gr{D} = \gr{C}_L$ and we have $\gr{C}_{L}=\gr{g}^{f_L}$ where $f_L=\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}$ is an integer.
Additionally $\gr{C}_R=\gr{g}^{f_R}$ for $f_R\gets f-\alpha \cdot f_L$.

$\mathcal{X}$ now computes the corresponding polynomials $f_L(X)\gets \dec(f_L)$ and $f_R(X)\gets \dec(f_R)$.
Now if for all $i$, the coefficients $f_i$ and $f'_i\in [-b,b]$ and $\alpha,\alpha' \in [-\frac{p-1}{2},\frac{p-1}{2}]$ then by the triangle inequality we have that for the $i$th coefficient of $f_L(X)$, $f_{L,i}\in [-2b,2b]$. Additionally we have $f_{R,i}=\frac{f_i'\alpha-f_i \alpha'}{\Delta_\alpha}$. Using the triangle inequality again we have that $f_{R,i} \in [-(p-1) \cdot b, (p-1) \cdot b]$. For an odd prime $p$, $(p-1)\cdot p\geq 2$. The bound on $f_{R,i}$ is, therefore, greater than the bound on $f_{L,i}$. This gives us $f_L(X),f_R(X)\in \ZZ({(p-1) \cdot b})[X]$

Let $y_L=\frac{y-y'}{\Delta_\alpha} \bmod p=\frac{f(z)-f'(z)}{\Delta \alpha} \bmod p$ and $y_R= y-\alpha\frac{y-y'}{\Delta_\alpha} \bmod p$. Since $f_L(X)=\frac{f(X)-f'(X)}{\Delta \alpha}$ this shows that $y_L=f_L(z)\bmod p$ and $y_R=f_R(z)\bmod p$.
%The actual bound on f_{R,i} is b*(p-2)

%%%%%DYADIC


\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:dyadicpolysecurity}}
\label{apx:dyadic}
We begin by stating and proving the combining lemma, (Lemma~\ref{lem:intrandomcombine}) for dyadic rational witnesses.
%PROOF FOR DYADIC RATIONALS
\begin{lemma}[Combining for Dyadic Rational Witnesses]
\label{lem:dyadiccombining}
Let $\tr$ and $\tr'$ be two transcripts as specified in Lemma \ref{lem:intrandomcombine} with the difference that $f,f'\in \mathbb{D}$ are dyadic rationals such that $f(X)\gets \dec(f)$ and $f'(X)\gets \dec(f')$ are degree $d$ bounded dyadic rational polynomials with coefficients' numerators bounded by $N$ and denominators bounded by $D$, i.e. $f(X),f'(X)\in\mathbb{D}(N,D)$.
Assume that there exists a PPT algorithm for taking square roots of any element in $\GG$ and that the order of $\GG$ is odd, then there exists a PPT algorithm $\mathcal{X}$ that given these transcripts computes either (1) $y_L,y_R\in \ZZ_p,f_L(X),f_R(X)\in \mathbb{D}(N\cdot (p-1),D\cdot (p-1))[X]$  such that $f_L(z)=y_L\bmod p$ and $f_R(z)=y_R \bmod p$ or (2) an element in $\GG$ of known order or (3) a non-power of $2$ fractional root of $\gr{g}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof follows a similar structure to the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:intrandomcombine}. 
		
	Using the transcripts we get $\Delta_\alpha\gets\alpha-\alpha'$ and $\Delta_f\gets f-f'$ such that $\gr{C}_{L}^{\Delta_\alpha}=\gr{g}^{\Delta_f}$. 
 If $\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}$ is not a dyadic rational then this gives us a non-power of $2$ fractional root of $\gr{g}$ root of $\gr{g}$, that is the tuple $(\Delta_f,\Delta_\alpha,\gr{C}_{L})$.  
 If $\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}$ on the other hand is a dyadic rational then we can compute $\gr{D}\gets\gr{g}^{\frac{\Delta_f}{\Delta_\alpha}}$. This may requires taking a power of $2$ root. By assumption the group order is odd, so every element has a square root and there exists an efficient algorithm for taking square roots. This implies that taking higher power of $2$ roots is also efficient.
  
  Now either $\gr{D} = \gr{C}_L=\gr{g}^{f_L}$ or we can extract an element of known order. Additionally $\gr{C}_R=\gr{g}^{f_R}$ for $f_R\gets f-\alpha \cdot f_L$.

 We now compute the corresponding polynomials $f_L(X)\gets \dec(f_L)$ and $f_R(X)\gets \dec(f_R)$.
Now if the coefficients $f_i$ and $f'_i\in \mathbb{D}(N,D)$ and $\alpha,\alpha' \in [-\frac{p-1}{2},\frac{p-1}{2}]$ then by the triangle inequality we have that for the numerator of the $i$th coefficient of $f_L(X)$ is between $[-2N,2N]$. The denominator grows by at most $p-1$. The bound on the denominators is therefore $D\cdot (p-1)$. Additionally we have $f_{R,i}=\frac{f_i'\alpha-f_i \alpha'}{\Delta_\alpha}$. Using the triangle inequality again we have that the numerator of $f_{R,i} \in [-(p-1) \cdot N, (p-1) \cdot N]$. The denominator is bounded by $D\cdot (p-1)$. This gives us $f_L(X),f_R(X)\in \mathbb{D}((p-1) \cdot N,D\cdot (p-1))[X]$

Finally $y_L=f_L(z)$ and $y_R=f_R(z)$ as in Lemma~\ref{lem:intrandomcombine}. It is important that $2$ is co-prime with the odd prime $p$ such that each dyadic rational can be mapped to a field element.
\end{proof}


We now restate the theorem for the security of the protocol with dyadic rational witnesses in groups where taking square roots is easy.

\def\thetheorem{\ref{thm:dyadicpolysecurity}}
\begin{theorem}
\dyadicmaintheorem
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof largely follows the same structure of the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:polycommitsecurity}.
	
We will prove security by showing that we can extract a dyadic rational polynomial $f(X)\in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ such that $f(X)$ has degree at most $d$ and the coefficients of $f(X)$ are dyadic rationals such that the product of the numerator and denominator is bounded by $q/2$. This ensures that $f(q)$ is a unique encoding of $f(X)$. Additionally $\gr{g}^{f(q)}=\gr{C}$ and $f(z) \bmod p=y$. The proof will use the general forking lemma (Lemma \ref{lemma:GFL}) to show that the polynomial commitment scheme has witness-extended emulation. 

We use the same extractor $\mathcal{X}$ as in Theorem \ref{thm:polycommitsecurity} with one key distinction. 
For $d+1$ odd we invoke the extractor described by Lemma~\ref{lem:dyadiccombining} instead of Lemma~\ref{lem:intrandomcombine}. 
This means that at every tree level either bounded dyadic rational witness polynomials are extracted or an element of known order or a non-power of $2$ fractional root of $\gr{g}$. By assumption the ladder two cases happen only with negligible probability.

We, therefore, now need to compute a bound on the size of the extracted polynomial. 
The check on $f$ ensures that $f\in \ZZ$ and that $|f|\leq b=\frac{p-1}{2} (\frac{p+1}{2})^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil}$. We can write $f\in\mathbb{D}(\frac{p-1}{2} (\frac{p+1}{2})^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil},1)$. By \ref{lem:intrandomcombine} both the numerator and the denominator grow by at most a factor $p-1$ in every round.
Given that the transcript tree has depth $\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil$ we get that the final extracted polynomial $f_0(X)\in \mathbb{D}(N,D)[X]$ has coefficients with numerators bounded by $N= \frac{p-1}{2}(\frac{p^2-1}{2})^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil}$ and denominators bounded by $D=(p-1)^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil}$

$q$ needs to be large enough such that $f_0(X)$ is uniquely decodable, \emph{i.e.}, $q>2\cdot N\cdot b=(p-1)^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil+1}(\frac{p^2-1}{2})^{\lceil \log_2(d+1)\rceil}$. In a simpler form $q>p^{3\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil+1}$ suffices.

This shows that we can successfully extract either a witness or a non-power of $2$ fractional root or an element of known order from any tree of valid transcripts.
Under the $2$-Fractional Root Assumption and the Order Assumption, the probability that a polynomial time adversary along with a polynomial time extractor $\mathcal{X}$ can produce such a a  non-power of $2$ fractional root or an element of known order is negligible. $\eval'$, therefore, has witness extended emulation and under the Adaptive Root Assumption by Lemma \ref{lemma:poe_security} so does $\eval$.
Lemma \ref{lem:ordertoadaptive} and Lemma \ref{lem:strongtofractional} show that we can reduce the hardness assumptions to just the Adaptive Root Assumption and the  $2$-Strong RSA Assumption. 
\end{proof}

%\section{Hiding Polynomial Commitment with HVZK Eval} 
%\label{appendix:zeroknowlege}
%\input{sections/zk}


\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:joined}} \label{appendix:joined}

\def\thetheorem{\ref{thm:joined}}
\begin{theorem}
\theoremjoined
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Correctness is immediate and witness extended emulation requires a single application of Lemma~\ref{lem:intrandomcombine} which leads to an updated bound on $q$. In general $q$ needs to be $\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ larger for any random linear combination that is taken with $\alpha \in [-\frac{p-1}{2},\frac{p-1}{2}]$. For class groups, Lemma~\ref{lem:dyadiccombining} is used and the lower bound on $q$ grows by a factor of $(p-1)^2\frac{p+1}{2}\leq p^3$.
\end{proof}



\section{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:IOPcompiler} (Polynomial IOP Compilation)}\label{sec:IOPcompilerproof}


\def\thetheorem{\ref{thm:IOPcompiler}}
\begin{theorem}
\theoremIOPcompiler
\end{theorem}

The fact that the compilation preserves HVZK is straightforward. We prove this part first and then move on to proving witness-extended emulation. 

\paragraph{HVZK}
\begin{proof} Let $S_\eval$ denote the HVZK simulator for $\eval$ and $S_\pro{IOP}$ denote the HVZK simulator for the original polynomial IOP. We construct an HVZK simulator $S$ for the compiled interactive argument as follows. 
$S$ begins by running $S_\pro{IOP}$ on the input $x$, which produces a series of query/response pairs to arbitrarily labeled oracles that are ``sent" from the IOP prover to the verifier. $S$ simulates the view of the honest verifier in the compiled interactive proof by replacing each distinctly labeled oracle with a fresh $\Gamma$ commitment to $0$, \emph{i.e.}, the zero polynomial over $\FF_p$. By the hiding property of $\Gamma$ this has negligible distance $\delta_0$ from the commitment sent in the real protocol.
(It places this commitment at the location in the transcript where the commitment to this oracle would be sent in the compiled protocol).
 For each query/response pair $(z, y)$ to an oracle, $S$ runs $S_\eval$ to simulate the view of an honest-verifier in the $\eval$ protocol opening a hiding polynomial commitment to the value $y$ at the point $z$. Let $P$ denote an upper bound on the total number of oracles sent and $Q$ denote an upper bound on the total number of queries to IOP oracles. 
If the simulation of $S_\pro{IOP}$ has statistical distance $\delta_1$ from the real IOP verifier's view, and each simulated $\eval$ subprotocol has statistical distance $\delta_2$ to the real $\eval$ verifier's view, then the output of $S$ has statistical distance at most $P \delta_0 + \delta_1 + Q \delta_2$ from $\textsf{View}_{\langle P(x, w), V(x) \rangle}$. For $P, Q < \poly$ and $\delta_0, \delta_1, \delta_2 < \negl$ this statistical distance is negligible in $\lambda$. 
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Witness-extended emulation (knowledge)}

\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality, assume the original IOP makes at least one query to each oracle sent. An oracle which is never queried can be omitted from the IOP.

We denote by $\verifier$ the IP verifier for the compiled IP, and $\verifier_{O}$ the verifier for the original IOP. 
Given a record oracle $\pro{Record}(P^*, \params, x, \st)$ for an IP prover $P^*$ that produces accepting transcripts with non-negligible probability, we build an emulator $E$ for the compiled IP. $E$ begins by constructing an IOP adversary $P'_{O}$, which succeeds also with non-negligible probability on input $x$. Every successful interaction of $P'_{O}$ with $\verifier_{O}$ on input $x$ corresponds to a successful transcript of $P^*$ with $V$ on $x$. In showing how $E$ builds $P'_{O}$ we also show how $E$ can obtain this corresponding transcript. $E$ will make use of the emulator $E_\eval$ for the commitment scheme $\Gamma$. %We will describe how this is done in the later parts of the proof. Accepting that this is true. 

Finally, $E$ can use the IOP knowledge extractor $E_{\pro{IOP}}^{P'_O}(x)$ in order to output a witness for $x$ along with the corresponding transcript. 

\paragraph{Constructing $P'_O$ (IOP adversary)}
$P'_O$ runs as follows on initial state $\st_0$ and input $x$. It internally simulates the interaction of $P^*$ and $V$, using the record oracle $\pro{Record}(P^*, \params, x, \st)$. It begins by running this for the first round on state $\st_0$. For every message that $P^*$ sends in this first round, $P'_O$ continues simulation until there is an $\eval$ on this commitment. (There is guaranteed to be at least one $\eval$ on each commitment, independent of the randomness). Therefore, denoting by $E_\eval$ the extractor for the $\eval$ subprotocol between $P^*$ and $\verifier$ on a given commitment and evaluation point, the record oracle can be used to simulate $E_\eval$'s record oracle.% for each $m$ evaluated at some point determined by $V$'s challenge.

For each message $m$ that $P^*$ sends to $V$ at the beginning of the first round, $P'_O$ interprets $m$ as a commitment, and attempts to extract from it a polynomial by 
running the PPT emulator $E_\eval$, simulating its record oracle as just described. \textbf{If it fails in any extraction attempt it aborts.} 

If $P'_O$ succeeds in all these extractions, then it uses these extracted polynomials as its first round proof oracles that it gives to $\verifier_O$. Upon receiving the first public-coin challenge from the IOP verifier, $P'$ uses the query function to derive the corresponding queries to each of these proof oracles. Before answering, it rewinds $P^*$ and $\verifier$ back to the point immediately after $P$ sent its first messages, and now substitutes random challenge from $\verifier_O$ in order to simulate $P^*$ and $V$ on these same queries. It checks that $P^*$'s answers are consistent with the answers it can compute on its own from the extracted polynomials. \textbf{If any answers are inconsistent, $P'_O$ aborts}. Otherwise, it sends the answers to $\verifier_O$. 

At the end of this first round (assuming $P'$ has not yet aborted), $P'_O$ has stored an updated state $\st'$ for $P^*$ based on this simulation. It proceeds to the next round and repeats the same process, using the record oracle $\pro{Record}(P^*, \params, x, \st')$. Finally, if $P'$ makes it through all rounds without aborting, then it has a final state $\st_V$ for $\verifier_O$ based on its internal simulation of $P^*$ and $V$ up through the end of the last round. Finally, $\verifier_O(\st_V)$ outputs $\pro{Accept}$ or $\pro{Reject}$. %(Observe that $\verifier_O$ accepts if and only if $\verifier$ would accept in the simulated transcript with $P^*$ because they run the same decision algorithm on the final state of query/response pairs). % $1$ on $\st_V$. (This is due to the fact that the verifier in the compiled IOP runs the same final decision algorithm as the IOP verifier). 

\paragraph{Analysis of $P'_O$ success probability} 
We claim that if $\pro{Record}(P^*, \params, x, \st_0)$ outputs an accepting transcript $\tr$ with non-negligible probability, then $P'_O$ succeeds with non-negligible probability. 

Observe that for any accepting $\tr$ between $P^*$ and $V$, if $P'_O$ happens to follow the same exact sequence of query/responses without ever aborting then it succeeds because $\verifier_O$ and $\verifier$ run the same decision algorithm on the final state of query/response pairs. Thus, it remains only to take a closer look at what events cause $P'_O$ to abort, and bound the fraction of accepting $\tr$ for which this occurs. 

As indicated in bold above, there are two kinds of events that cause $P'_O$ to abort: 
\begin{itemize}
\item It fails to extract from a ``commitment" message $m$ sent by $P^*$
\item After successfully extracting a polynomial $f$ from a commitment, $P^*$ answer queries to $f$ in a way that is inconsistent with $f$. 
\end{itemize}

The second type of event contradicts the evaluation binding property of $\Gamma$, therefore it occurs with negligible probability. 

To analyze the first type of event, let us define ``bad commitments" for a parameter $D$. We define this as a property of a message $m$ (purportedly a commitment) sent in a transcript state $\st$.

\paragraph{Bounding probability of commitment extraction failure} 
The pair $(m, \st)$ is a ``bad commitment" if there is less than a $1/D$ probability that extending the transcript between $P^*$ and $\verifier$, starting from state $\st$, will contain a successful execution of $\eval$ on $m$. This probability is over the randomness of the public-coins of $\verifier$ in the extended transcript. %have a succesful execution on (over the randomness of the public-coins) that $\pro{Record}(P^*, \params, x, \st)$ contains a successful execution of $\eval$ on $m$ on the queries defined by $\st$ and the next public coin challenge, where $\st$ is determined by running $\tr$ up until the point $m$ appears. 


Let $A(\tr)$ denote the event that a transcript $\tr$ sampled from $\pro{Record}(P^*, \params, x, \st_0)$ is accepting. Let $B(\tr)$ denote the event that $\tr$ contains a ``bad commitment" (i.e. some message $m$ sent in state $\st$ such that $\pro{Bad}(m, \st) = 1$). The conditional probability of event $A(\tr)$ conditioned on event $B(\tr)$ is less than $1/D$. To see this, fix $(m, \st)$ with $\pro{Bad}(m, \st) = 1$ and consider ``sampling" a random $\tr$ that contains $m$ at state $\st$. This is done by first choosing randomly from all partial transcripts that result in $(m, \st)$ via brute force, and then running the transcript normally from state $\st$ on random public-coins. No matter how $(m, \st)$ is chosen, the probability that this process produces an accepting transcript is by definition less than $1/D$. (The second part of the transcript following $(m, \st)$ contains at least one execution of $\eval$ on $m$ by hypothesis, and by the definition of $B(m, \st) = 1$ this execution is accepting with probability less than $1/D$).

Assume that $P(A(\tr)) \geq 1/\poly$. Applying Bayes' law, %letting $A(\tr)$ denote the event that $\tr$ is accepting and $P(A(\tr)) > 1/\poly$ the a-priori probability of this event, 
\[ P[B(\tr) | A(\tr)) \leq \frac{ P[A(\tr) | B(\tr)] }{ P(A(\tr)) } \leq \poly / D \enspace . \]
In other words, at least a $1 - \poly/D$ fraction of accepting transcripts do not contain ``bad commitments". %By a union bound, in a length $L$ transcript void of bad commitments, the transcript does not contain any failed $\eval$ with probability at least $L/B$. 
Furthermore, so long as a commitment $m$ is not ``bad", we can invoke the witness-emulation property of $\eval$ to say that the PPT $E_\Gamma$ emulator extracts a witness polynomial from each $m$ with overwhelming probability.


Setting $D = 2 \poly$ we get that on at least a $1/2$ fraction of accepting transcripts, $P'_O$s simulation also succeeds (i.e. successfully extracts from each prover commitment message) with probability at least $1/2$. This means that $P'_O$ has a non-negligible success probability conditioned on the event that $\tr$ is an accepting transcript. 

In conclusion, if $\tr$ is accepting with non-negligible probability, then there is a non-negligible probability that $P'_O$ succeeds. 
\end{proof}
